# Colorbox 
A color picker skin for Rainmeter

## Features
- Pick colors based on R, G, B, H, S, V
- Pick colors from your screen (Thanks to [this addon](https://forum.rainmeter.net/viewtopic.php?f=128&t=4215), you need to install the rmskin to use this feature)
- Save colors to swatches

## Note
- This is a side project I made for Rainmeter learning back then
- Skin is may have bugs and not fully tested
- Pull requests are welcome if you would like to contribute
